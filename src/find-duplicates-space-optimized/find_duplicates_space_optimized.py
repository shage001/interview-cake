def find_duplicates( arr ):
	"""
	**********************************************************************************************************************
	We have an array of integers, where:
	
	The integers are in the range 1..n
	The array has a length of n+1
	It follows that our array has at least one integer which appears at least twice. But it may have 
	several duplicates, and each duplicate may appear more than twice.
	
	Write a function which finds any integer that appears more than once in our array.
	
	We're going to run this function on our new, super-hip Macbook Pro With Retina Display™. Thing is, 
	the damn thing came with the RAM soldered right to the motherboard, so we can't upgrade our RAM.
	So we need to optimize for space!
